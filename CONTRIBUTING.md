# Contribute to Factions framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing towards Factions Framework! It's
people like you that help keep projects like this alive - it's appreciated.

But before you open an issue ticket or create a pull request we need to talk
about a few things.

## Titles

Please create the titles of your Issues and Pull Requests informative! Titles
like "error", "fixes bugs", or "makes better" are not helpful. Here are some
general ideas:

* Improve class lookup speed
* Bug with Factions 2.7.5 and PlayerMoveEvent

## Issues

When submitting an issue it's best to include as much detailed information about
your server, your plugins, and what cause the issue. Please always provide:

* Your server type and version (Spigot, CraftBukkit, PaperSpigot, Sponge, or whatever else
* Your Factions version
* Your startup log (remove any sensitive information if you have to)
* The full error log including the entire stack trace and a few lines above and below it

The issue is not always with Factions Framework but sometimes with how other
plugins interact with it. So don't be offended if your issue is marked external
and closed.

## Pull Requests
